Planet Crypton | Multi-Brainwallet - JavaScript Client-Side Multiple Cryptocoin Address and Bitcoin Transaction Generator

https://github.com/ScioMind/PlanetCrypton.Multi-Brainwallet

This is the Planet Crypton (http://PlanetCrypton.com) branded version of the excellent Brainwallet by Brainwallet.org

This project is open source and public domain.

--------------------------------------------------------

The primary value of this project is its ability to generate Bitcoin transactions in a fairly simple way, without the need for running any Bitcoin software/wallet other than the javascript contained in this project.  (This does require queries to online bitcoin resources, but does not expose your private keys.)

A secondary value of this project its ability to generate public/private key-pairs for the various crypto-coins which it supports, all in one simple to use, multiple-coin interface.  It should be noted, however, that many different single-coin key-pair generators already exist, often with features not found in this project.  (One such feature is the ability to generate very large numbers of key-pairs simultaneously, for example.)  That said, this project is good at what it does: key-pair (public address and private key) generation for multiple crypto-coins, and generation of bitcoin transactions.

--------------------------------------------------------

ONLY BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS ARE SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME.  WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THIS TO SUPPORT TRANSACTIONS FOR OTHER COINS.

WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO ADD DARKCOIN IMPLEMENTATION TO THIS PROJECT.
